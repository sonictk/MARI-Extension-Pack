##Info
General Development Area for custom nodes, custom shaders and Python scripts
Mirroring www.mari.ideascale.com.

This includes all User Content including Python Scripts and user created Nodes

##GIT Workflow

We have adopted the git flow branching model.

A comprehensive Step-by-Step is available on the Twiki:
https://github.com/campi3d/IdeascaleNodePack/wiki/Making-a-change---step-by-step-Tutorial


In order to keep track of things it would be good if major new features just get noted down in the release notes within the DEV Branch
so we have some sort of easy way to assemble release information.
