#MARI EXTENSION PACK 2.2 DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

Copyright (c) 2015 www.mari.ideascale.com. All Rights Reserved.


##Developer Notes for this Branch (Please read):

At the time of writing this the DEV Branch is now based on MARI 3.
While Python tools should work (mostly) in Mari 2.6 Nodes & Shaders
will not load in 2.6 due to a change in RegisterCustomShader.py.

It is recommended, if you are on 2.6, to branch of master and commit
to your own created branch so we can cleanly merge it in for Mari 3.

Thanks,
Jens



##Version:
Extension Pack :  2.2  //  MARI Function Library: 1.12


##What's new in 2.2:

Please refer to DEV_RELEASE_NOTES.md for a list of addition we already made for ExtensionPack 2.2


##Info
General Development Area for custom nodes, custom shaders and Python scripts
Mirroring www.mari.ideascale.com.

This includes all User Content including Python Scripts and user created Nodes

##GIT Workflow

We have adopted the git flow branching model.

A comprehensive Step-by-Step is available on the Twiki:
https://github.com/campi3d/IdeascaleNodePack/wiki/Making-a-change---step-by-step-Tutorial


In order to keep track of things it would be good if major new features just get noted down in the release notes within the DEV Branch
so we have some sort of easy way to assemble release information.
